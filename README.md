# DefectTrackingTool
Final year project


PeopleZ Defect Tracking Tool (PDTT) is a simple web based defect tracker which allows user to collaborate on bugs and track activity throughout the life of the bug, all the way until it gets solved. Defects can be tagged individually for easy categorization and groupings. PDTT brings complete test plan management so that testers can associate their work with development activity and customer incidents and also provides complete traceability between codes commits, issues, defects and change requests. PDTT is used to define planning tests, executing tests, tracking defects, alerting on changes, and analyzing results.

PDTT prioritize the defects as per their importance and impact on the clientâ€™s business, updates the status of the defect time to time, maintains defects throughout the SDLC/ STLC and identifies the duplicate defects.
